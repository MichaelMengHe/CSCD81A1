Answer the following questions. Be concise and clear
but explain carefully when needed.

1 .- (1 marks) Of BFS and DFS, which search algorithm yields the best results? (i.e. which is more likely
     to get the mouse to the cheese safely before being eaten?)

     BFS is more likely to get the mouse to the cheese first safely.


2 .- (1 marks) Does this mean that in general BFS is a better search algorithm? (yes/no and give reasons to
     support your answer based on your observations)

     No, if there are multiple cheeses in the game, and they all exist very far from the mouse, then the mouse would benefit from
     DFS, since there is a higher chance to ealier discover one of the cheeses hidden in very deep into the search.


3 .- (2 marks) Describe the heuristic function you used for A* search. Why is this heuristic admissible?

     Shortest Manhatten distance is used for the heuristic, since the Manhatten distance guarentees the shortest distance
     from mouse node to cheese node, then h(n) <= h*(n), therefore the heuristic is admissable.


4 .- (1 marks) Explain how your heuristic function accounts for the presence of multiple cheeses.

     The heuristic will calculate the shortest Manhatten distance from the mouse to all cheese nodes, and the shortest one will be
     selected. So presence of multiple cheeses are accounted for.


5 .- (1 marks) Is A* equivalent to BFS for this problem? or is it better/worse? explain your answer based on 
     your observations.

     A* is better than BFS for this problem, since the heuristic leads the mouse to the cheese goals rather than uniformly searching
     all nearby nodes. So it will find cheese faster.

6 .- (2 marks) Describe your heuristic function for A*-nokitty. How does it work? what factors are considered
     into the cost function? is it admissible (yes/no and why)?

     The heuristic chosen for no kitty is the Manhatten distance to nearest cheese squared, and this is subtracted
     by Manhatten distance to nearest cat squared.
     The factors considered are how close the mouse is to the nearest cheese, which should be rewarded, so it is squared. 
     But more importantly, avoiding the cat must be done at all costs, so the kitty distance is squared as well.
     This heuristic is inadmissable since h(n) > h*(n), the cost will be greater than the actual distance.

7 .- (2 marks) What is the largest limitation of the search algorithms implemented in this assignment?
     (i.e. is there anything we are missing that could lead to a smarter mouse?) - this is
     a more or less open question, but we talked about it in lecture!

     The limitations of BFS, DFS and A* is that they are all very rigidely defined algorithms, to optimally find the solution
     given it's style of search. However, when kitty are introduced, the algorithms fail to adapt well to surviving and avoiding the cats.
     So a better algorithm would be more fleexible, and willing to exxchange some optimality to avoid kitties well.

Marking:

(5 marks) Correctly implementing BFS - the search
          runs and produces the expected search
          behaviour.

(5 marks) Correctly implementing DFS - the search
          runs and produces the expected behaviour.

(5 marks)  A* heuristic function is implemented, reasonable,
           and admissible.

(10 marks) Correctly implementing A* search - the search
           runs and produces the expected behaviour.

(10 marks) Implemented a **clever**  A*-nokitty heuristic
           and a working A*-nokitty search. The search
           should produce a smarter mouse than all of
           BFS/DFS/A*.

           The heuristic should accounts for known game 
           factors that affect the mouse's chance of success.

           (to be marked competitively - smartest mouse
            in the class earns full marks)

(10 marks) Answers in this report file

(up to 15 marks) Assigned by the TA based on how smart your
		 mouse actually is. Mind what is going on in
		 the game, and think about how to make your
		 mouse most likely to win!
